For this project, I was given a prompt to create an R package that performed functions requested, with specific names, inputs, and outputs.

These functions needed to perform linear modeling using the bag of little bootstraps sampling method.

Reinforced knowledge of writing complex functions in R, creating packages in R, and linear modeling.
